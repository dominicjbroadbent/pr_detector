Established in 1972, the company’s accumulated knowledge of service delivery and recycling technologies gives our clients peace of mind that their wastes are being managed by industry experts. At our Materials Recycling Facility (MRF) near London we apply state-of-the-art technologies to process a comprehensive range of waste materials. We are committed to delivering the most sustainable methods for managing wastes and use the concept of the “Hierarchy of Waste” to guide us. We encourage clients to minimise their generation of waste and, where possible, suggest innovative ways of reusing or reconditioning items rather than recycling them. We continuously re-visit and re-evaluate our processes and procedures for managing each material stream in an attempt to push the methodology higher up the waste hierarchy. Our Research & Development and Commercial teams work closely to identify innovative recycling technologies and end-uses for the materials we process. McGrath operates a “Zero to Landfill” policy. Advances in sorting technology combined with our development of a partner network of specialist materials re-processors enables us to divert all non- hazardous wastes from landfill allowing our clients to contribute directly to the UK’s circular economy. Our company is also pioneer in the UK’s waste-to-energy sector. The development of our innovative packaging plant allows us to collect and dispatch residues from our materials recycling facilities (MRFs) for Waste to Energy processing. This diverts materials which would otherwise be sent for landfill. It is processed into Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) or Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF). We operate an integrated management system which is certificated against international standards ISO 45001 (health & safety), ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental) and ensures our products and services are supplied safely, consistently and sustainably. \n",
