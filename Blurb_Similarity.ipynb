Established in 1972, the company’s accumulated knowledge of service delivery and recycling technologies gives our clients peace of mind that their wastes are being managed by industry experts. At our Materials Recycling Facility (MRF) near London we apply state-of-the-art technologies to process a comprehensive range of waste materials. We are committed to delivering the most sustainable methods for managing wastes and use the concept of the “Hierarchy of Waste” to guide us. We encourage clients to minimise their generation of waste and, where possible, suggest innovative ways of reusing or reconditioning items rather than recycling them. We continuously re-visit and re-evaluate our processes and procedures for managing each material stream in an attempt to push the methodology higher up the waste hierarchy. Our Research & Development and Commercial teams work closely to identify innovative recycling technologies and end-uses for the materials we process. McGrath operates a “Zero to Landfill” policy. Advances in sorting technology combined with our development of a partner network of specialist materials re-processors enables us to divert all non- hazardous wastes from landfill allowing our clients to contribute directly to the UK’s circular economy. Our company is also pioneer in the UK’s waste-to-energy sector. The development of our innovative packaging plant allows us to collect and dispatch residues from our materials recycling facilities (MRFs) for Waste to Energy processing. This diverts materials which would otherwise be sent for landfill. It is processed into Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) or Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF).

Based on the CentraLock asset management and security technology, which was originally designed for the cash-in-transit arena, the challenge was to explore a range of opportunities to break into this new market with this exciting new technology.The CentraLock system provides centralised, cost-effective management and control of sensitive assets throughout widespread estates without any need for expensive data infrastructures. The patented use of a smartphone to provide a dynamic link between any site being managed, however remote, and a central management server makes CentraLock access control not only practical but alsoviable. \n",

      "At FIERCE we make some great, flavour packed beers. From Hoppy to Fruity. From dark and mysterious to seasonal weird crazy stuff. One thing is for sure - once you have had FIERCE Beer - nothing else will do. HOW IT ALL STARTED creativity from diversity Fierce Beer founders Dave Grant and David McHardy are both Oil and Gas veterans. After falling out of love with the corporate world, they first met during Brewing Technology training in Sunderland and decided to follow their dreams - to open a microbrewery and make great beer! On 1st April 2016 they moved into the brewery premises. Equipment was delivered and installed, and the inaugural brew took place on 3rd May 2016. FINDING OUR STYLE At FIERCE, we like strong, bold '​in your face'​ flavours - so we developed a range of beers that deliver on that promise. We also are keen gastronauts, and we think that our beers pair really well with food. Check out the food pairing recommendations with each beer style. We split our range into four key areas: Hoppy. Pale ales and IPAs that are hop forward and hop flavoured. Fruity. Pale ales loaded with fruit purees, and sour beers that will pucker the palate Dark. Stouts and Porters with adjuncts like spices, coffee, nuts Seasonals. (aka crazy sh*t). Look out for ginger, habanero, wombat (ok, no wombat) We believe in Flavour, Quality, Provenance. GREAT INGREDIENTS Maximum flavour! To get maximum flavour in our beer, we only use natural stuff. We also source local ingredients wherever possible. Flavour is added throughout our brewing process. In every step, from the kettle to the fermentation tanks and conditioning vessels. Continual flavour loading, and lots of it. We don't pasteurise our beer or use nasty fining chemicals, so our beers are suitable for vegetarians Doing all this ensures that none of those flavour molecules try to make a break for it. Those little guys are all for you!  \n",

Instead, glamorous head and wrist candy that is destined to be every girls best friend with beautiful colours and styles that jazz-up luscious locks. The next step was to offer the same stylish twist to footwear – Lou set about developing Poplaces™, a super-stretchy sport shoelace that allows you to slip your shoes and trainers on and off without ever needing to undo them! The design team at Popband London are constantly working on new colours, prints and styles to satisfy the huge appetite for cute, fashionable and functional accessories.

      "Centennial Medical Care, Elstree, is a new modern private outpatient hospital based in Elstree, Herts, on the perimeter of the London area. We cover most areas of medicine that can be carried out on an outpatient basis with a strong focus on paediatrics, womens health and sports injury. CMC offer an unrivaled team of highly experienced GP’s and consultants from all major hospitals saving patients the time, cost and inconvenience it takes to travel into Central London. We have a strong team of both male and female GP’s and offer an efficient and easily accessible GP service open seven days a week. We have the same GP’s on the same days and have taken great care in selecting only experienced doctors who have been established in the local area for many years. We do not use locum GP’s ensuring continuity of service for our patients. The cost of our GP service is the most competitive in the area as are our fees for imaging and blood testing. CMC has an elite team of sports and exercise consultants and physiotherapists. All of our doctors have strong links with Premiership football clubs and the National Team. The sports teamwork in a multidisciplinary approach ensuring the best treatment plan for the patient. Sports consultants deal with all acute muscular skeletal injuries and are often a preferred route over orthopaedic consultants. Centennial Medical Care recognised early on there was a huge lack of paediatric care outside of Central London – we obtained a zero plus CQC license allowing us to consult and treat from birth. Many senior paediatricians work with us covering areas such as general paediatrics through to paediatric psychiatry, psychology and neuro developmental testing. CMC are also one of the only clinics outside of Central London with an obstetric accreditation. We also offer a frontline paediatric service where a worried parent can come to us and see a paediatrician instead of a GP. No referral is necessary and this is available at a reduced cost to a regular paediatric consultation. Centennial Medical Care offers on site ultra-sound imaging and houses a fully equipped minor operating theatre. CMC also has priority arrangements and reduced pricing for local imaging including MRI and CT. CMC recognises the huge demand for aesthetic treatments. As a hospital our main focus is medical aesthetics where all our treatments are carried out by doctors – these treatments include: Medical tattooing, PRP, removal of benign skin lesions, anti-wrinkle injections and fillers. CMC offers a modern and professional approach and environment whilst managing to maintain the personal relationship we have with both consultants and patients. Our patient experience is paramount. CMC will always offer the most appropriate and best treatment for our patients even if this isn’t within our hospital. This is possible due to the strong clinical pathways we have created and built. \n",
